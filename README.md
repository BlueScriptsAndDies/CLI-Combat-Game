# CLI Combat Game

Welcome to CLI Combat Game. Not really a game just a small project I am working on in python.

I hope you some-what enjoy the game.

I Dont really know python so dont expect lots.

# Score Keeper Update!

Now added a score keeper. whenever you lose it will display your score and your highscore.

Not much but enjoy! :D

# Future Plans

Mob API

This will make it so enimies will now go towards you and hopefully fix mob bugs.

# Movements

Currently there are "W" to move forward, "S" to move backwards and "F" to fight.
